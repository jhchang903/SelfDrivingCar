# Self-Driving Car
This repository includes the projects of Self-Driving Cars Specialization from Couresera.\
The section __PROJECTS__ shows the final project of each course.\
The section __PRACTICE__ shows the codes that implementing crucial theory for self-driving car.

## PROJECTS

[C1_Final_Vehicle_Control](C1_Final_Vehicle_Control)
* This is the final project of the course __Introduction to Self-Driving Cars__
* The goal of this project is to implement longitudinal (PID) control and lateral (Pure Pursuit) control to track the desired waypoints.

[C2_Error_State_Extended_Kalman_Filter](C2_Error_State_Extended_Kalman_Filter/Error-State_Extended_Kalman_Filter.ipynb)
* This is the final project of the course __State Estimation and Localization for Self-Driving Cars__
* In this project, an Error-State Extended Kalman Filter is implemented to localize a vehicle. The filter relies on IMU data to propagate the state forward in time, and GPS and LIDAR data to correct the state estimate.

[C4_Motion_Planning](C4_Motion_Planning)
* This is the final project of the course __Motion Planning for Self-Driving Cars__
* The self-driving veihcle has to track the deired path while avoiding static vehicle and it needs to keep a safe distance while following a preceding vehicle once they close.
